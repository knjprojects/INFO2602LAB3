			<h1>Sample Poem</h1>
			<h2 class="text-align:center">Little mermid</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">Why won't students come to labs? This is something I always ponder. After unprepared
				students write exams, They watch their marks in wonder.</p>
			<p>Why won't students come to labs? What is more important than class? How can you be a student if you don't even
				try to pass?</p>
			<p>Why won't students come to labs? It happens all the time. If you came to labs, you'd know what to do. But you
				would rather duck and go lime.</p>
			<p>Why won't students come to labs? I see them all now stressing. If you only learned this basic programming, You
				would surely now be zessing.</p>
